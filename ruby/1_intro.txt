Why learn Ruby?
  Ruby is used in many places including:
    normal people stuff:
      google sketchup api # http://www.sketchup.com/intl/en/developer/index
        custom drawing tools, plugins
      medicine and biology
        http://www.jblearning.com/catalog/9780763750909/
      twitter # not any more
      motorola for research
      NASA Langley Research Center uses Ruby to conduct simulations
      soundcloud
      hulu

    developer stuff:
      http://brew.sh/
      https://github.com/
    also: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/success-stories/
  And, it's a beautiful language (show some nice code)

OS X comes with Ruby, but it's 1.8.7 and it's buggy and slow. Upgrade.

To launch: 
  Windows: command prompt
  UNIX: Terminal
  type irb<enter>

# talk about ints, floats, strings, and puts/methods/functions like
String#to_i, Fixnum#to_s and Float#to_s

# something like:
So if you've never programmed, just enter a number, and hit enter.
Thats how you represent a number in Ruby. Pretty simple. You can even
do math. Try typing "4 + 8". Notice that it works with or without the
spaces. Use "*" for multiplication, and "/" for division. "**" does
exponents. Try "3*9+4**4/2". You can also use parentheses,
try "3*9+4**(4/2)" and see that Ruby follows the order of operations

# now explain floats, and why "5/2 != 2.5"

# then strings and puts
